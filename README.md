# Insurance-Cost-Prediction

## Do you know what is Health Insurance?
Health insurance is a type of insurance product that specifically guarantees the health costs or care of the insurance members if they fall ill or have an accident.

In this project, we aimed to develop a high-performance algorithm to predict insurance charges using information such as beneficiary’s age, sex, BMI, no. of children, residential area and smoking habit. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. We will conduct an analysis of a health insurance data in the US. The dataset used can be found on Kaggle.[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) This dataset contains 1338 rows.

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression analysis is a linear relationship between two or more independent variables (X1, X2, X3, …, Xn) with the dependent variable (Y). This analysis is to determine the direction of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, whether each independent variable is positively or negatively related and to predict the value of the dependent variable if the value of the independent variable increases or decreases.

The aim of this project is to evaluate and investigate the feasibility. The machine learning algorith used for predicting insurance cost is multiple linear regression and inference is provided on the features on which the insurance costs rely the most and which factors affect the insurance costs.

Columns

age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
